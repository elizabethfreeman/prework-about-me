      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>How do you sum yourself up in a paragraph? I'm a busy person that's in between careers at the moment. I worked for a cruise line in the Youth Entertainment sector for 10 years and prior to that was a teacher. Learning code and computer skills is intimidating to me but I can't help but feel excited about this next chapter and to see all the challenges that it brings.  </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Born in North Carolina, raised in Florida, citizen of Planet Earth and lover of world travel.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Running, puzzles, reading, enjoying the finest craft beer that downtown Sanford has to offer.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I'm naturally a creative person with a desire to work hard. I don't know what my dream job would be right now but I find myself wanting to own my own business more and more. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Sanford, Florida</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I felt that in order to progress in the work force that acquiring new skills, particularly in the digital domain would be necessary. </p>
